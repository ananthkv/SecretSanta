<h1>Only 1 step to go! - Validate your participation</h1>
<p>
    To prevent bots or trolls to ruin the Secret Santa party, we need the list organizer <b>fds</b> to validate his or her participation. We've sent a mail to <b>jimmyhdx@gmail.com</b> with further instructions.
</p>
<p>
    Once validated, your Secret Santa list will be scrambled and all users will receive your message along with the name of their Secret Santa gift buddy.
</p>
<p>
    In the validation e-mail the list organizer will also find a link to keep track of all users in their Secret Santa list who've already found out their gift buddy. Making sure every Secret Santa knows his duty.
